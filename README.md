This repository will be showcasing the transition from almost zero knowledge in coding JAVA to learning basic functions, hierarchies, and data types. The transition took place during the first half of my freshman year of high school. The labs that I have completed were created by Jared Stites, www.bwagner.org, or www.apluscompsci.com.
